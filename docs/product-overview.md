# Product Overview

UpPersona is a personal-branding SaaS for solo operators (e.g., real estate agents) who want one workspace to plan, create, schedule, and learn—without juggling a dozen tools.

## What it does
- **AI content**: generates scripts, video/carousel ideas, captions, and hashtags tailored to the user’s onboarding profile and template library.
- **Publishing**: schedules and posts across major social channels (Instagram/Meta live; TikTok/YouTube planned), with local asset uploads supported.
- **Analytics**: shows reach, engagement, and follower growth per platform after accounts are connected.
- **Guidance**: in-app help, filming guides, and tonality tips to improve output quality.

## Customer promise
- Replace 10+ disjointed tools with one workflow from idea → AI generation → scheduling → analytics.
- Make it fast to produce on-brand content via personalization (onboarding profile + templates).
- Provide confidence via scheduling, audit trails, and performance insight.

## Outcomes we optimize for
- Faster content throughput (ideas/week, scheduled posts).
- Higher engagement/growth per connected platform.
- Lower operational friction (fewer tools, fewer failed posts).

The implementation follows a clean, scalable architecture so features can evolve from local development to production without rewrites.
